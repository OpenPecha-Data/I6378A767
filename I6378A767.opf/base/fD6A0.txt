Unchanging Auspiciousness

In Praise of Mañjuśrī

by Mipham Rinpoche

Oṃ. Unchanging auspiciousness, the Three Jewels—You are the basis from which they originate
and emerge,Sublime among refuges, well suited to protection,Mañjuśrī, the supreme possessor
of splendour.

Attuned to beings’ perception through space and time,You perform the dance of illusory manifestation,Yet,
upon investigation, do not abide as an objectOf ordinary conception—to you I
pay homage.

You are the most peaceful among the peaceful:Gentle Splendour, supremely free from distress.In
form, great, all-encompassing compassionIn the play of youth—to you I pay homage.

You are the most wrathful of the wrathful:Destroyer of Yama, exterminator of all,Devourer of
existence and peace into basic space,Great enemy of time—to you I pay homage.

Your vajra form is indivisible appearance and emptiness,You are the actual wisdom of all the
victorious ones,The omnipresent lord Samantabhadra—Mañjuvajra, to you I pay homage.

By the virtue of paying homage to and praising you,From now until I attain the essence of awakeningMay
the wisdom light of Mañjuśrī, Gentle Splendour,Forever infuse the lotus at my heart.


This tribute which combines the essenceOf all tantras of Mañjuśrī, peaceful and wrathful,Is
to be cherished as the very heartOf all forms of praise to Mañjuśrī.

Mipham composed this praise, which opens fully the doors of interdependence to the wonder of
sky-like profundity and vastness, during the Wood Mouse year. May it become a cause for the
perpetual increase of unending virtue and auspiciousness. Athaṃ. Maṅgalaṃ.
