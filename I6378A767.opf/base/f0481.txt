Descent of the Compassionate Blessings of King Gesar, Great Lion of this World
by Mipham Rinpoche

hrih, tsa sum kündü pema tötreng gi
Hrīḥ! Great lion of this world, emanated through the compassion
tukjé ku trul dzamling sengchen jé
Of Pema Tötreng Tsal, embodiment of all the Three Roots,
dralha werma patul dangmen ché
Together with the dralas, wermas, brave warriors and maidens,
mögü dungshuk drakpö chendren na
I invoke you all with intense and fervent devotion:
tukjé tsé gong tanda dir shek la
Consider us lovingly with compassion and come here now.
nyikma ngaden dü kyi tama dir
During this, the end of time, rife with fivefold degeneration,
khyé lé resa kyabné zhen mepar
We have no other hope, no other source of refuge but you.
chöden rik kyi nyugu sungwé chir
To safeguard the fresh seedlings of the dharmic lineage,
ngönsum jinlab chenpö datak ché
Confer your compassionate blessings upon this fortunate one
kalden di la tukjé jingyi lob
And make plain the signs and symbols of great inspiration.
lü la drala wermé pakhar chö
Forge from this body a fortress for the dralas and wermas,
go sum dorjé sum du jinlab né
Bless my body, speech and mind as the three vajras,
lodrö pobpa tutob nüpa kyé
Increase my intelligence, confidence, power, strength and capacity,
kham sum si sum wang du duwa yi
And grant me the attainment of universal victory,
chok lé nampar gyalwé ngödrub tsol
Bringing all three realms and planes of existence under my control.
Recite the mantra and perform the descent of blessings.
