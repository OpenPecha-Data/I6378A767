↑ There is some disagreement about why this practice is referred to as Chinese. In its fuller
form it makes use of the Chinese astrological system (nag rtsis). It has also been suggested
that the name derives from the fact that the fuller dhāraṇī was originally translated
into Chinese. The full text is here: https://www.lotsawahouse.org/words-of-the-buddha/averting-periodic-obstacles↑
A form of Mañjuśrī.↑ That is, obstacles associated with a particular
