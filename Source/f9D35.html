	<h2>The Sword of Wisdom for Thoroughly Ascertaining Reality</h2>
<p><em>by Mipham Rinpoche</em> </p>
<p>1. You have not the slightest confusion about philosophy,<br/>
And have completely abandoned every fault,<br/>
Your mind has no doubts about the three pointsâ<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a><br/>
Before MaÃ±juÅrÄ«, the treasure of wisdom, I bow.</p>
<p>2. Profound, vast and difficult to realize<br/>
Is the nectar-like teaching of the sugatasâ<br/>
To those who long to taste it,<br/>
I here grant the light of intelligence.</p>
<p>3. The Dharma taught by the Buddha<br/>
Depends entirely upon the two levels of truth,<br/>
The relative truth of the mundane<br/>
And the truth of the ultimate meaning.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>
<p>4. If one is to apply an unerring and certain mind<br/>
To the nature of these two truths,<br/>
One must cultivate the excellent vision<br/>
Of the two flawless valid cognitions.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
<p>5. These appearances in all their rich variety<br/>
Arise through dependent origination.<br/>
Something that is truly independent,<br/>
Like a lotus in the sky, will not appear.</p>
<p>6. It is a complete gathering of causes<br/>
That functions to bring about an effect.<br/>
All effects, whatsoever they may be,<br/>
Depend upon their own particular causes. </p>
<p>7. It is by knowing what is or is not the case<br/>
In terms of causes and their effects<br/>
That we pursue one thing and avoid another,<br/>
Whether in crafts or in philosophyâ </p>
<p>8. They all have this as their starting point.<br/>
This includes not only worldly disciplines,<br/>
But also the training that transcends the world.<br/>
All phenomena, arisen in mutual dependence, </p>
<p>9. Naturally possess their own particular<br/>
Characteristics, which are uniquely theirs.<br/>
The plain and simple facts of the conventionalâ<br/>
Solidity, fluidity, warmth and so onâare incontestable. </p>
<p>10. Even just a single thing has countless properties,<br/>
And can be classified in infinite ways,<br/>
Based on affirmation and negation.<br/>
These are natural features of the thing itself. </p>
<p>11. An object that is perceived clearly and directly,<br/>
Has properties that seem separate and distinct,<br/>
But these distinctions are mental designations,<br/>
Distinguished and engaged with by conceptual mind. </p>
<p>12. Actual substance and what is imputed conceptuallyâ<br/>
These are two ways in which one can understand<br/>
All that can be known, and many are the categories<br/>
That come from further elaborating on these two. </p>
<p>13. Just so, they have their own causes, effects and natures,<br/>
But when phenomena are investigated authentically,<br/>
That which brings about arising cannot be observed,<br/>
Nor is there anything that arises in dependence.</p>
<p>14. Each thing appears with its own identity,<br/>
Yet is empty by its very nature,<br/>
Absolute space with threefold liberation,<br/>
The very nature of the ultimate.</p>
<p>15. How something functions and how it depends<br/>
Are both aspects of its particular nature,<br/>
So it is with a thingâs nature that reasoning ends,<br/>
And it would be futile to enquire any further.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>
<p>16. This kind of evaluation of things in their nature,<br/>
According to each of the two levels of reality,<br/>
Is proven by the basic facts of how things are,<br/>
So it is reasoning that establishes what is tenable.</p>
<p>17. How things appear or how they ultimately abide,<br/>
Can be known through perceiving their nature directly,<br/>
Or it can be inferred unerringly based on<br/>
Something else which is clearly apparent. </p>
<p>18. Direct perception itself is of four kinds:<br/>
Unmistaken sensory, mental, self-awareness<br/>
And yogic; all of which are non-conceptual,<br/>
Since their objects appear with specific characteristics. </p>
<p>19. Without these direct perceptions<br/>
There would be no evidence and hence no inference,<br/>
And any perception of things arising from causes<br/>
And then ceasing would become impossible.</p>
<p>20. If that were the case, how could we ever<br/>
Understand them to be empty and so on?<br/>
Without relying upon the conventional,<br/>
There can be no realization of the ultimate.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a></p>
<p>21. Cognitions brought about by the five senses<br/>
Clearly experience their own objects.<br/>
Without this direct sensory perception,<br/>
Like blind folk, we would fail to see.</p>
<p>22. Mental direct perception arises from the faculty of mind,<br/>
And clearly determines both outer and inner objects.<br/>
Without it, there would be no aspect of consciousness<br/>
Capable of perceiving all types of phenomena.</p>
<p>23. Yogic direct perception is the culmination of meditation<br/>
Practised properly and according to the instructions.<br/>
It clearly experiences its own objects, and without it<br/>
There would be no vision of objects beyond the ordinary. </p>
<p>24. Just as this direct experience can eliminate<br/>
Misperceptions about outer forms and the like,<br/>
This is also how it is within the mind itself,<br/>
If there were some other knower, there would be no end to them.</p>
<p>25. A mind that is cognizant and aware<br/>
Naturally knows its objects, but at the same time<br/>
Is also aware of itself, without relying upon something else,<br/>
And this is what is termed âself-awarenessâ.</p>
<p>26. Any experience of the other direct perceptions<br/>
Is only determined to be actual direct perception<br/>
By means of self-awareness; without this<br/>
There would be no way of establishing it.</p>
<p>27. The root of inference lies in direct perception,<br/>
And direct perception is determined by self-awareness.<br/>
It all comes down to the experience of an undeluded mind;<br/>
There are no other means of establishment beyond this.</p>
<p>28. Therefore, it is based on direct perceptions,<br/>
Which are non-conceptual and undeluded,<br/>
That misperceptions of apparent phenomena<br/>
Can be decisively eliminated.</p>
<p>29. The conceptual mind is that which<br/>
Conceives of objects by way of general images,<br/>
Associating them with names to form concepts,<br/>
From which stem all manner of words and thoughts. </p>
<p>30. Even for someone unaware of the proper expression,<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a><br/>
Generic images will appear in the mind,<br/>
Ready to be named, and through such concepts,<br/>
Objects can still be pursued or avoided.<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a></p>
<p>31. Without this conceptual mind,<br/>
There could be no conventions of affirmation or denial,<br/>
And it would be impossible to infer anything<br/>
Or communicate the points of training. </p>
<p>32. Conceptual thought enquires into and establishes<br/>
That which is not evident directly, such as future pursuits.<br/>
Without this ability to infer things conceptually,<br/>
We would all become like newborn babies. </p>
<p>33. A reason is information that allows us to know something else.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a><br/>
The reason must be a feature of the subject,<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a><br/>
And there must be positive and negative logical pervasionâ<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a><br/>
When these three modes are present, there can be no delusion. </p>
<p>34. From a reason that is arrived at through<br/>
Valid direct perception and valid inference,<br/>
What is hidden can be logically inferred,<br/>
And things can be proven by means of relationship.</p>
<p>35. There are reasons that are results and natural reasons.<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a><br/>
When a thing is not observed or its opposite is seen,<br/>
Something is negated for the reason that it cannot be observedâ<br/>
Like this, there are three types of evidence in all.</p>
<p>36. From a genuine perspective, all appearances<br/>
Are now, and always have been, the same;<br/>
And since a pure mind sees only purity,<br/>
Their nature remains entirely pure.</p>
<p>37. Real functioning things dependently arise,<br/>
And what is unreal is dependently imputed;<br/>
Therefore both the real and the unreal<br/>
Are empty by their very nature.</p>
<p>38. In the way things are, one cannot separate<br/>
A thing which is empty from its own emptiness.<br/>
So appearance and emptiness are indivisibly united,<br/>
This is inexpressibleâone must know it for oneself!</p>
<p>39. Any affirmation, whatsoever it may be,<br/>
Must affirm either existence or identity;<br/>
And any negation, whatsoever it may be,<br/>
Must negate either existence or identity.</p>
<p>40. Negations and affirmations based on what is valid<br/>
May be set out definitively in the proper way,<br/>
And then, while remaining logically consistent,<br/>
One can prove a point to others or make a refutation.</p>
<p>41. When it comes to refutation, you can compose<br/>
Your own syllogisms including all three modes,<br/>
Or you can state the consequences that follow<br/>
From the opponentâs very own assertions.</p>
<p>42. Within the conventional, there is that which<br/>
We call âimpure and narrow visionâ because<br/>
Reality and appearances do not coincide,<br/>
And a vision in which things are purely seen.</p>
<p>43. This makes two types of conventional validity,<br/>
Like seeing with eyes that are human and divine.<br/>
The difference between the two lies in their<br/>
Essential natures, causes, results and functions.</p>
<p>44. One is an undeceived cognition of limited scope,<br/>
That arises from a correct perception of its object,<br/>
Clearing misperceptions of things in a narrow field of vision,<br/>
To bring a thorough apprehension of a given object.</p>
<p>45. One is a pristine cognition of what is vast in nature,<br/>
That arises from an observation of precisely how things are,<br/>
Clearing misperceptions of objects beyond the imagination,<br/>
To bring the result of wisdom that knows all there is.</p>
<p>46. The absolute as well has its two aspects:<br/>
Categorized and uncategorized conceptually,<br/>
And then to evaluate them, two types of validity<br/>
For looking into what is ultimately true.</p>
<p>47. It is by relying on the former that one reaches the latter.<br/>
Like impaired vision that is healed and made pure,<br/>
When the eye of valid cognition is fully developed,<br/>
The truth of purity and equalness can be seen.</p>
<p>48. It is because the mind, both with concepts and without,<br/>
Is sometimes deludedâas when perceiving two moons,<br/>
Dreaming or believing a rope is a snakeâ<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> and sometimes not,<br/>
That we have the categories of valid and invalid cognition.</p>
<p>49. Without these categories of valid and invalid cognition,<br/>
A clear separation between the deluded and false<br/>
And the undeluded and true would be impossible,<br/>
And the tenets of philosophy could not be put forward.</p>
<p>50. When we investigate on the level of reality,<br/>
In spite of all these conceptual elaborations,<br/>
Based on classifications such as direct perception,<br/>
Inference, valid and invalid cognition and so on, </p>
<p>51. All is empty by its very nature.<br/>
And this natural simplicity itself<br/>
Is a feature of all conventional constructs,<br/>
Just as heat is a property of fire. </p>
<p>52. So it is that appearance and emptiness<br/>
Are inseparable in all phenomena<br/>
As the method and its outcome,<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> which is why<br/>
You cannot negate one and affirm the other.</p>
<p>53. âWithout investigating what is and is not valid,<br/>
But through mundane perception alone,<br/>
Can one enter into the ultimate?â you may ask.<br/>
It is true that this is not ruled out.</p>
<p>54. Seeing how this thing is produced from that thing<br/>
Is the direct perception of ordinary people,<br/>
Based on which they infer and make predictionsâ<br/>
In fact, this is â<em>pramÄá¹a</em>â in all but name.</p>
<p>55. Without the two kinds of conventional valid cognition,<br/>
Pure visions would seem false, and, even for the impure,<br/>
It would be unfeasible to say of a conch shell,<br/>
âWhite is its true colour, and yellow it is not.â</p>
<p>56. Without the two approaches to ultimate analysis,<br/>
We would not know the unity of the two truths,<br/>
The ultimate would fall into conceptual extremes,<br/>
And be a cause for its very own destruction.</p>
<p>57. The relative, that which is examined, is not real.<br/>
So too the probing mind and self-awareness.<br/>
When we look, they are not there, like the moon in waterâ<br/>
This is the ultimate indivisibility of the two truths.</p>
<p>58. This is the one truth, nirvÄá¹a, the limit of reality,<br/>
It is the ultimate state of all phenomena,<br/>
Enlightened being wherein knowing and known are inseparable,<br/>
Pure wisdom experience, without limit or centre.</p>
<p>59. Once the excellent eye of discriminating wisdom<br/>
Has opened to the profound and vast like this,<br/>
One sees the noble path travelled by<br/>
The bliss-gone buddhas and their heirs,</p>
<p>60. Those enlightened beings of mighty intelligence.<br/>
This is the way of the sÅ«tra and mantra vehicles,<br/>
So difficult to find. When we have the opportunity,<br/>
Let us not fail to gain the result!</p>
<p>61. Possessing in this way the four reasonings,<br/>
And endowed with the light of intelligence,<br/>
Let us not be deceived by others, but investigate<br/>
And be sure to follow the four reliances.</p>
<p>62. If we do not have this understanding,<br/>
Then, like a blind man leaning on his staff,<br/>
We can rely on fame, mere words or what is easy to understand,<br/>
And go against the logic of the four reliances.</p>
<p>63. Therefore do not rely on individuals,<br/>
But rely upon the Dharma.<br/>
Freedom comes from the genuine path that is taught,<br/>
Not from the one who teaches it.</p>
<p>64. When the teachings are well presented,<br/>
It does not matter what the speaker is like.<br/>
Even the bliss-gone buddhas themselves<br/>
Appear as butchers and such like to train disciples.</p>
<p>65. If he contradicts the MahÄyÄna and so on,<br/>
Then however eloquent a speaker may seem,<br/>
He will bring you no real benefit,<br/>
Like a demon assuming Buddhaâs form.</p>
<p>66. Whenever you study or contemplate the Dharma,<br/>
Rely not on the words, but on their meaning.<br/>
If the point is understood, it matters little<br/>
How eloquently or not the words were spoken.</p>
<p>67. Once you have understood what the speaker<br/>
Intended to communicate, if you then continue<br/>
To think about each word and expression,<br/>
It is as if your elephant is found, yet still you search.</p>
<p>68. If you misinterpret the words they will only increase,<br/>
And youâll never stop till you run out of thoughts,<br/>
All the while straying further and further from the point.<br/>
Like a child at play, youâll only end up exhausted.</p>
<p>69. Even for a single phrase like âFetch the wood!â<br/>
Out of context, thereâs no end to what it might mean.<br/>
Yet if you understand what is meant,<br/>
The need for the words ends just there.</p>
<p>70. When a finger points to the moon,<br/>
The ignorant look at the finger itself.<br/>
Fools, who are attached to language alone,<br/>
May think they understand, but it will not be easy.</p>
<p>71. When it comes to the meaning of what is taught,<br/>
You should know the provisional and definitive,<br/>
And rely not on any provisional meaning,<br/>
But only on the meaning that has certain truth.</p>
<p>72. The All-Knowing One himself, in all his wisdom,<br/>
Taught in accord with studentsâ capacities and intentions,<br/>
Presenting vehicles of various levels,<br/>
Just like the rungs of a ladder.</p>
<p>73. Wisely, he spoke with certain intentions in mind,<br/>
As with the eight kinds of implied or indirect instructions.<br/>
If taken literally, these might be invalidated,<br/>
But they were spoken for specific reasons.</p>
<p>74. From the four schools of buddhist philosophy<br/>
Through to the ultimate vajra vehicle,<br/>
Aspects not fully realized by the lower approaches,<br/>
Are made clear by those which are more advanced.</p>
<p>75. Seeing it to be superior according to the texts and logic,<br/>
The intelligent seize the definitive meaning<br/>
Like a swan drawing milk from water,<br/>
And revel in the ocean of buddhist teachings.</p>
<p>76. The teachings of the profound vajra vehicle are also sealed<br/>
By means of the six limits and four modes.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a><br/>
But can be definitively established by stainless reasoning,<br/>
Accompanied by the pith instructions of the lineage.</p>
<p>77. The inseparable union of the primordial purity<br/>
And great equalness of all phenomena<br/>
Is the point that is definitively established<br/>
By the two authentic valid cognitions.</p>
<p>78. By applying the key points of the literal, general,<br/>
Hidden and ultimate meaning, without any conflict<br/>
In the approaches of the pÄramitÄs, development phase,<br/>
Completion phase and the Great Perfection,</p>
<p>79. One gains the confidence of certainty about reality.<br/>
Then the supremely intelligent heirs of the buddhas<br/>
Come to master an inexhaustible treasury of Dharma,<br/>
As a sign of victory for the teachings of scripture and realization.</p>
<p>80. When taking the definitive meaning into experience,<br/>
Do not rely upon the ordinary dualistic mind<br/>
That chases after words and concepts,<br/>
But upon non-dual wisdom itself.</p>
<p>81. That which operates with conceptual ideas is the ordinary mind,<br/>
Whose nature is dualistic, involving âperceiverâ and âperceivedâ.<br/>
All that it conceptualizes in this way is false,<br/>
And can never reach the actual nature of reality.</p>
<p>82. Any idea of something real or unreal, both or neitherâ<br/>
Any such concept, however itâs conceivedâis still only a concept,<br/>
And whatever ideas we hold in mind,<br/>
They are still within the domain of MÄra.</p>
<p>83. This has been stated in the sÅ«tras.<br/>
It is not by any assertion or denial<br/>
That we will put an end to concepts.<br/>
But once we see without rejecting or affirming, there is freedom.</p>
<p>84. Although it is without any perceiving subject or object perceived,<br/>
There is naturally occurring wisdom that is aware of itself,<br/>
And all ideas of existence, non-existence, both and neither have ceased completelyâ<br/>
This is said to be supreme primordial wisdom.</p>
<p>85. Just like the orb of the sun to someone blind since birth,<br/>
This has never been seen by the spiritually immature.<br/>
However much they think about it, they fail to understand,<br/>
And so it is only a cause of fear in the minds of the foolish.</p>
<p>86. Yet through scriptures of authentic origin,<br/>
Reasoning that refutes all four conceptual extremes,<br/>
And the force of the masterâs practical instructions,<br/>
It arises in our experience, like sight that is restored.</p>
<p>87. At that time, with a faith that comes from savouring<br/>
The nectar-like taste of the Buddhadharma,<br/>
Our eyes open widely in purest joy<br/>
And we glimpse the buddhasâ wisdom kÄya.</p>
<p>88. In this, all things without exception<br/>
Are seen in their ultimate state of equality,<br/>
And with this certainty about what is itself beyond expression,<br/>
Skillfully, one expresses the unending treasury of Dharma.</p>
<p>89. Having become learned in the ways of the two truths,<br/>
When seeing the reality of their inseparable unity,<br/>
One knows that, just as a husk is removed to reveal the grain,<br/>
All the various methods are simply to lead one to this point.</p>
<p>90. With the thought, âSkilled in means are the buddhas,<br/>
And all these methods make a genuine path,â<br/>
An irreversible sense of confidence will arise<br/>
In the teachers and their teachings.</p>
<p>91. By gaining the supreme non-abiding wisdom,<br/>
Naturally one is freed from the extremes of existence and quiescence,<br/>
And the ornament of great and effortless compassion<br/>
Arises to pervade throughout the furthest reaches of space and time.</p>
<p>92. When the correct approach to the two truths<br/>
Is realized through contemplating the four reasonings<br/>
In this way, it brings the four genuine reliances.<br/>
From such a supreme and flawless cause as this</p>
<p>93. Comes the result of profound primordial wisdom.<br/>
When this experience is developed to its fullest<br/>
It releases the eight great treasures of confidence<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a><br/>
That were sealed within the absolute space of awareness. </p>
<p>94. Scriptures heard and contemplated in the past<br/>
Are never forgottenâthis is the treasure of recollection.<br/>
Knowing precisely their profound and vast pointsâ<br/>
This is the treasure of intelligence.</p>
<p>95. Understanding all the themes of the sÅ«tra and tantra collectionsâ<br/>
This is the treasure of realization.<br/>
Never forgetting any detail from oneâs studiesâ<br/>
This is the treasure of retention.</p>
<p>96. Satisfying all beings with excellent explanationsâ<br/>
This is the treasure of confidence.<br/>
Safeguarding the precious treasury of sacred teachingsâ<br/>
This is the treasure of Dharma.</p>
<p>97. Not severing the continuous line of the Three Jewelsâ<br/>
This is the treasure of bodhicitta.<br/>
Gaining acceptance of the nature of equality beyond arisingâ<br/>
This is the treasure of accomplishment.</p>
<p>98. Someone who has mastered these eight great inexhaustible treasures<br/>
Will never separate from them, and<br/>
Will be praised by the buddhas and their heirs<br/>
And become a sovereign of the three worlds.</p>
<p>99. The valid teachings of the victorious buddhas<br/>
Are established by the valid cognitions,<br/>
So by developing confidence through the valid path,<br/>
The true result of the valid teachings will be seen.</p>
<p>100. With noble vision, completely and utterly pure,<br/>
And great compassion that has reached perfection,<br/>
The bliss-gone buddha revealed the path<br/>
And said, âThe taste of this nectar I have discovered</p>
<p>101. Should be experienced by means of<br/>
The four reasonings and the four reliances.â<br/>
Although a portion of this elixir has now been shared,<br/>
In this modern age rife with degeneration,</p>
<p>102. Through all the methods that run counter to this approach,<br/>
It is difficult to savour the supreme taste of the teachings.<br/>
With this in mind, and with an altruistic intention<br/>
And a mind of supreme devotion for the teachings,</p>
<p>103. I have here briefly explained how to generate<br/>
The immaculate wisdom that is born of reflection.<br/>
Through the merit of this may all beings<br/>
Become the very equal of MaÃ±juÅrÄ«!</p>
<p>104. Turned towards the sun of MaÃ±juÅrÄ«âs speech,<br/>
The water-born lotus of my heart opens in devotion,<br/>
May these golden honey drops of excellent explanation<br/>
Become a plentiful feast for the bees of good fortune!</p>
<p><em>I had had the intention to write this for a while, but in accord with the recent request made by the learned scholar Lhaksam Gyaltsen, this was written in a single day by Jampal Gyepa on the twenty-ninth of the third month of the Sakyong year (i.e., Wood Bird, 1885). Mangalam. There are one hundred and four verses. Let virtue abound!</em></p>

<p>Mipham Rinpoche in his own commentary, <em>Don rnam par nges pa shes rab ral gri mchan bcas</em> (hereafter MR), says that this refers to the three modes of a valid inference. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>In the well-known syllogism, âGiven the subject of sound, it is impermanent because it is createdâ this refers to the fact that sound is created. <a href="#fnref:9" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>In the above example, positive logical pervasion would be the fact that whatever is created is impermanent.
