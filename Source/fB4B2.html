	<h2>The Wheel of Analytical Meditation That Thoroughly Purifies Mental Activity</h2>
<p><strong><em>by Mipham Rinpoche</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>Namo maÃ±juÅrÄ«ye!</em><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>
<p>Whatever problems there are in the world<br/>
Are created by the afflictions in our own minds.<br/>
A mistaken attitude is a cause for the <em>kleÅa</em>s,<br/>
Yet the pattern of our thoughts can be refined. </p>
<p>Here there are three sections: 1) how to meditate, 2) the measure of
progress, and 3) the significance of the practice.</p>
<h3>1. How to Meditate</h3>
<h4>Multiplicity</h4>
<p>Imagine someone who stirs in you intense attachment,<br/>
And consider them now present vividly before you.<br/>
Separate this person into five component skandhas,<br/>
And begin by investigating the physical body. </p>
<p>Consider all its impure substances<br/>
Of flesh and blood, bones, marrow, fat,<br/>
Internal organs, limbs and organs of sense,<br/>
Faeces, urine, bacteria, hair, nails and the like,<br/>
And the components of earth and other elements. </p>
<p>Think of all these aspects, each of which<br/>
Can still be divided even further, and then,<br/>
Down to the very tiniest particle,<br/>
Mentally dissect them all stage by stage,<br/>
Checking whether you feel desire for each in turn. </p>
<p>Since there is nothing we could call âbodyâ<br/>
Apart from these substances, varied and impure,<br/>
A body is just like an unclean contraption,<br/>
A field of grass, wall of bricks, mound of waste,<br/>
Or a mass of bubbling foam. </p>
<p>Seeing this fact, sit and consider it mindfully.<br/>
Once the momentum of this insight fades,<br/>
Turn to feelings, perceptions, formations and consciousness,<br/>
And look into their nature,<br/>
By dividing them into their various aspects. </p>
<p>When you see them as insubstantial like bubbles,<br/>
A mirage, a plantain tree or a magical illusion,<br/>
You will understand how in these too there is nothing<br/>
To which one could ever be attached.<br/>
Continue with this thought until it fades.<br/>
Then, once it does, do not try to prolong it,<br/>
But turn instead to another investigation. </p>
<h4>Impermanence</h4>
<p>Reflect deeply on how these aggregates,<br/>
Which are impure and lack real essence,<br/>
Do not remain once they have arisen,<br/>
But perish from one moment to the next. </p>
<p>All the civilizations and societies of the past,<br/>
Met with only destruction in the end,<br/>
And so will those of today and ages yet to come.<br/>
The nature of the conditioned can inspire disenchantment. </p>
<p>Death is certain for all living things,<br/>
Suddenly it comes, and without warning.<br/>
Reflect on how all that we experience in life<br/>
Is changing from one moment to the next. </p>
<p>In summary, to the best of your ability,<br/>
Consider all the aspects of impermanence<br/>
That characterize conditioned things.<br/>
Reflect on each in turn with lucid thoughts. </p>
<p>Recognize how the aggregates of those that we desire,<br/>
Are transient as lightning, evanescent like bubbles,<br/>
And fleeting like clouds in the sky.<br/>
Until the momentum of this idea fades,<br/>
Focus your attention on nothing else. </p>
<h4>Suffering</h4>
<p>Then consider how within each of the aggregates,<br/>
Which are momentary and consist of many aspects,<br/>
There are experiences we might describe as pain itself,<br/>
And those that seem pleasant until they change. </p>
<p>Yet they all provide the cause for future woes,<br/>
And thus the skandhas are the basis of suffering.<br/>
Reflect as well, as much as you are able,<br/>
On all the misery there is within the world. </p>
<p>All is due to the skandhasâ imperfections.<br/>
There is not the tiniest speck or pin-tipâs worth<br/>
Of these contaminated aggregates<br/>
That is free from the defect of suffering. </p>
<p>As they are the source of suffering,<br/>
The skandhas are likened to a filthy swamp,<br/>
A pit of burning coals or an island of demons.<br/>
Remain with this insight for as long as you can. </p>
<h4>Selflessness</h4>
<p>Finally, investigate these aggregates,<br/>
Which have many aspects and are impermanent,<br/>
And whose suffering nature has now been shown,<br/>
And look for what it is that we call âI.â </p>
<p>When you see that, like a waterfall,<br/>
A shower of rain or an empty house,<br/>
They are devoid of any intrinsic self,<br/>
Remain until this conviction fades. </p>
<p>When it does disappear, then once again<br/>
Investigate in the stages as they have been shown.<br/>
Sometimes contemplate in no particular sequence,<br/>
Or else investigate a variety of things. </p>
<p>Practise investigating these points again and again,<br/>
Sometimes considering anotherâs aggregates,<br/>
Sometimes looking into your own,<br/>
And at times, analyzing all that is conditioned.<br/>
Let your attachment to anything be undermined. </p>
<p>In short, renounce any thought that does not<br/>
Involve an investigation of these four points,<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a><br/>
And turn the wheel of analysis again and again.<br/>
The more you analyze, the more your certainty will grow. </p>
<p>Apply therefore a clear mind of intelligence<br/>
To all kinds of observations just like these,<br/>
And, like wildfire spreading across a grassy plain,<br/>
Practise continually without interruption. </p>
<p>Say to yourself: âIn the past, I would always<br/>
Get caught in my mistaken ideas and attitudes,<br/>
Which led to all kinds of useless speculation,<br/>
But now I will consider only this instead.â </p>
<p>If you find yourself getting tired,<br/>
Yet notice that the afflictions still do not arise,<br/>
Even without your applying the antidote,<br/>
Then rest in equanimity to refresh your mind. </p>
<p>After a while, once your tiredness is no more,<br/>
Repeat the investigation just like before,<br/>
At all times being mindful and aware<br/>
Of the insight the investigation brings. </p>
<p>If, at times, you slip into forgetfulness,<br/>
And the afflictions have occasion to arise,<br/>
Then take up this investigation once more,<br/>
Like reaching for a weapon when enemies appear. </p>
<p>Just as light will banish darkness,<br/>
It is almost needless to say that<br/>
A precise investigation such as this,<br/>
Even if it is only practised a little,<br/>
Will do great harm to the kleÅas. </p>
<p>However much one understands the flaws<br/>
Of this conditioned saá¹sÄric world,<br/>
One will also understand the unconditioned,<br/>
NirvÄá¹aâs supreme and refreshing peace. </p>
<h3>2. The Measure of Progress</h3>
<p>Eventually, through familiarity with this practice,<br/>
You will naturally appreciate how everything<br/>
Included within the five skandhas and the conditioned<br/>
Is manifold, impermanent, painful and devoid of self. </p>
<p>Even without any deliberate effort,<br/>
The whole of your experience<br/>
Will seem magical and insubstantial,<br/>
And you will overcome the kleÅas. </p>
<p>When it is free from the waves of the afflictive emotions,<br/>
The ocean of your mind is made serene and calm.<br/>
This is conducive to gaining mental self-control,<br/>
Through which one reaches the samÄdhi of calm abiding. </p>
<p>If you can then look into the very identity<br/>
Of the mind in one-pointed concentration,<br/>
That is the extraordinary insight of vipaÅyanÄ. </p>
<p>It is here that one finds the initial entry point<br/>
That is common to all three vehicles. </p>
<h3>3. The Significance of the Practice</h3>
<p>All illusory phenomena which arise interdependently,<br/>
Have never arisen since the very dawn of time,<br/>
And so in emptinessâthe lack of phenomenal identityâ<br/>
They are beyond extremes such as sameness or difference. </p>
<p>This absolute space of great indivisible equality,<br/>
Is also known as the essence of the sugatas.<br/>
Once it is realized, one finds the great nirvÄá¹a<br/>
That abides in neither existence nor quiescence. </p>
<p>This is supremely pure and blissful,<br/>
The great unconditioned, totally permanent,<br/>
The great self-identityâthese are its<br/>
Transcendent and unsurpassable qualities. </p>
<p>This is the theme of the highest secret essence tantras,<br/>
The all-pervading space of ultimate co-emergent bliss,<br/>
It is also referred to as ânaturally arising wisdom',<br/>
A state in which all phenomena have total perfection.<br/>
To introduce this directly through the masterâs<br/>
Pith instructions is the approach of the Great Perfection. </p>
<p>Therefore, as a preliminary training<br/>
For the mahÄyÄna path of both sÅ«tra and mantra,<br/>
Breaking through the shell of confusion surrounding the conditioned,<br/>
This path of precise investigation is excellent indeed. </p>
<p>First, through the power of fine analysis,<br/>
One destroys the marks of rising afflictions.<br/>
Then through confidence in the emptiness of the aggregates,<br/>
One lets go of desires and hopes based on the three realms,<br/>
And eventually, by progressing in stages, all conceptual notions<br/>
Are pacified completely within the state of emptiness. </p>
<p>Not wishing for any antidotes or further relinquishing,<br/>
One is freed entirely from attachment and clinging to extremes.<br/>
With the purest compassion beyond attachment,<br/>
One courses through existence without the slightest fear,<br/>
Like a bird soaring through absolute space,<br/>
And attains the level of a supreme bodhisattva. </p>
<p>Based on the texts of noble masters, I have here explained<br/>
The important points of the paths of the three vehicles,<br/>
Which provide a thorough purification of mental activity,<br/>
As a preliminary to the paths of Åamatha and vipaÅyanÄ. </p>
<p>The more familiar you become with this practice<br/>
Of thoroughly purifying activities of the mind,<br/>
The more the afflictions will diminish,<br/>
And the subtler the kleÅas will become. </p>
<p>This will make it easier to practise Åamatha,<br/>
And just like gold that is treated in fire<br/>
So it becomes malleable and ready to craft,<br/>
Mind will be refined once it is freed from attachment. </p>
<p>Imagine if someone were to offer plentiful gifts<br/>
To the Three Jewels for a thousand godly years.<br/>
It is said in the sÅ«tras that the merit of this generosity<br/>
Is surpassed by the merit of even a momentâs reflection<br/>
On impermanence, emptiness and selflessness. </p>
<p>This is because the teachings say that<br/>
To recite the Four Seals of the MahÄyÄna Dharma<br/>
Is equivalent to understanding the teachings<br/>
In the eighty-four thousand sections of the Dharma. </p>
<p>If you meditate well on the points explained here,<br/>
Since they bring together the key points of many thousands of sÅ«tras,<br/>
You will easily gain the treasure of knowing perfectly the profound and vast,<br/>
And liberation will swiftly follow in its wake. </p>
<p>By the virtue of this explanation, may all beings<br/>
Tormented by the troubles of this degenerate age,<br/>
Meet this elixir-like teaching on non-attachment,<br/>
And, through its power, reach a state of perfect peace. </p>
